# pingdown CLI Help (generated)

This file is intended to be generated by the helper script. Run scripts/update-help.sh to refresh it from the program's --help output so it always stays in sync with the CLI.

Example output (may be slightly different depending on your build):

```
pingdown 1.4.8
H-Chris233

A tiny network connectivity monitor that can gracefully shut down the system when connectivity is lost.

Usage: pingdown [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]...

Arguments:
  [TARGETS]...  Target IP address(es) or domain name(s) to check

Options:
  -s, --strict                 Enable strict verification mode (all targets must succeed)
  -c, --config <FILE>          Read configuration from a JSON file (same format as README)
  -r, --read-json              Deprecated: read ./config.json from current directory
  -n, --normal <SECS>          Interval (in seconds) between regular checks [default: 60]
  -e, --emergency <SECS>       Interval (in seconds) between emergency retries [default: 20]
  -t, --tries <NUM>            Maximum number of emergency retry attempts before shutdown [default: 3]
  -v, --verbose...             Increase output verbosity (-v, -vv). Conflicts with --quiet and --status-only
  -q, --quiet                  Suppress per-target messages; only summaries are printed
      --status-only            Only print structured status summaries (no per-target ping logs)
      --progress               Show a progress spinner while waiting between checks
  -h, --help                   Print help
  -V, --version                Print version

EXAMPLES:
  # Check one target every 60s (default)
  pingdown 8.8.8.8

  # Strict mode, two targets, normal=30s, emergency=10s, attempts=5
  pingdown -s -n 30 -e 10 -t 5 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8

  # Use configuration file
  pingdown --config ./config.json

  # Quiet summary-only output, show progress spinner
  pingdown --status-only --progress 1.1.1.1
```
